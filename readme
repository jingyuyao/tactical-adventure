Required dev tools:
- JDK 7+
- Intellij Idea
- Android SDK

Android set up:
1. Download commandline tools from https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads
2. Unpack it to somewhere like $HOME/Documents/android
3. Create an environment variable that points to the previous location by adding this line to .profile
    `export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Documents/android` (need to re-login for it to take effect)
4. Use $ANDROID_HOME/tools/android to download the latest platform, platform-tools, build-tools

Follow this guide for Intellij Idea to import and run the project:

Additional quirks:
- Make sure "Android Support" plugin is enabled for Intellij Idea
- Set the SDK for the android module to Android SDK in Project Structure...->Modules->android
- For your sanity don't use the Android emulator and run it on a real phone instead
