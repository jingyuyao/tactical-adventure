1-START-grit-0=Finally! I see the edge of this goddamn desert!
1-START-chocho-1=We gotta get around this ridge quickly! It won't be long before they catch up \
  to us. I heard the alarm go off as soon as we stole these ships...
2-END-grit-0=What the... How did they catch up to us so quickly?
2-END-boss-1=These dam idiots sure knows how to steal ships. Too bad they can't read a map. \
  We saw their tracks go in a circle like three times during our chase. Now they are flying right \
  into our trap...
20-END-boss-0=Hahahaha! You will all die here! Fire at once!
