  \n\nObjective\n\
  The objective of each level depends on the story. Pay attention to the clues in the dialogue \
  as to what you need to accomplish to complete the level. Most often the level can be completed \
  by defeating a particular or all the enemies.\
  \n\nThe world\n\
  The world contains rectangular grid of terrains. Each terrain have a particular movement cost \
  associated with it. This number shows how much movement point does it cost for a ship to move \
  onto the terrain. Each terrain can hold a single ship. A ship may contain a pilot and holds various \
  numbers of items and weapons. Player ships are surrounded by a blue bracket when its actionable \
  and by a gray bracket when its not. Enemy ships are surrounded by a red bracket. A ship is destroyed \
  when its HP reaches zero!\
  \n\nYour turn\n\
  Each of your ships gets one move action and one item action per turn. Select any ship with a blue \
  bracket around it to start planning its action for this turn. The areas the ship can move to is shaded \
  in blue. You can tap on any blue shaded tile to move the ship or you can just skip moving and use an item immediately. \
  Item actions includes using a consumable like a Repair Kit or using a weapon to attack. A set of X \
  shaped blue target markers will appear when you choose a weapon. Tap on \
  any of the target markers to see the exact damage area (shaded in red) the weapon will hit. \
  Different weapons can have different special effects so read the item descriptions carefully. \
  You can also open a detailed view of the ship you selected by clicking on the overview panel \
  on the top right of the screen. You can equip and unequip items for a ship in this view if it has not \
  yet performed an action.\
  \n\nSaves\n\
  The game is saved automatically whenever a ship performs an action. You can clear your progress for \
  the current level in the main menu if you made an unrecoverable mistake (or deleted your overall \
  progress if you are truly stuck).\
  \n\nNow go have some fun!
